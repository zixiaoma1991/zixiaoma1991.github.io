I am currently a distinguished postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington with affiliation in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Clean Energy Institute, hosted by [Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Iowa State University, advised by [Zhaoyu Wang](https://wzy.ece.iastate.edu/).

My research interests include modeling, control, optimization and machine learning for power systems. Here is my [CV](https://zixiaoma1991.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
